description.reference=One important feature of the Warnings Plugin is the classification of issues as \
  new, outstanding and fixed. To compute this classification, the plugin requires a reference build (baseline). \
  New, fixed, and outstanding issues are then computed by comparing the issues in the current build and in the baseline.
title.ignoreQualityGate=Ignore the results of the quality gates when determining the reference build
title.failOnError=Fail the build if errors have been reported during the execution
title.status.total=Totals
description.status.total=If the total number of issues is greater or equal than one of the specified thresholds, then a \
  build is considered as unstable or failed, respectively. Values less or equal zero are ignored.
title.status.new=New Issues
description.status.new=If the number of new issues is greater or equal than one of the specified thresholds, then a \
  build is considered as unstable or failed, respectively. Values less or equal zero are ignored.

title.trendChartType=Trend Chart Type and Position

title.skipPublishingChecks=Skip publishing of checks to SCM provider platforms
title.skipDeltaCalculation=Skip SCM delta calculation to identify new issues
title.checksAnnotationScope=Select the scope of source code annotations

threshold.100.percent=100%
threshold.0.percent=0%
description.health.limit=Configure the thresholds for the build health. If left empty, then no health report is created. \
              If the actual number of warnings is between the provided thresholds, then the build health is interpolated.
title.health.severities=Health Report Severities
description.healthy=Report health as 100% when the number of issues is lower than this value.
description.unhealthy=Report health as 0% when the number of issues is greater than this value.
