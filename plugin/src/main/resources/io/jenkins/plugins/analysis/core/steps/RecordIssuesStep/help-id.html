<div>
    The results of the selected tool are published using a unique ID (i.e., URL) which must not be already used by
    another tool in this job. This ID is used as a link to the results, so choose a short and meaningful name.
    Allowed elements are characters, digits, dashes and underscores (more precisely,
    the ID must match the regular expression <code>\p{Alnum}[\p{Alnum}-_]*</code>).
    If you leave the ID field empty, then the built-in default ID will be used.
